# Modpack

We use and maintain a modpack for the server that adds some minimal quality-of-life features and includes a lot of performance mods to make the game run better. We mainly have this modpack to make the installation and updating of the [Proximity Voicechat](./Features/vc.md), which we use extensively, a lot easier for everybody.

The modpack is not required to join the server but it is recommened to at least install the [Proximity Voicechat mod](pathname://https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) as we all use it.

## Installation

You can watch [this tutorial](pathname://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPwIr_54KVo) or follow the steps below.

1. Download the Modrinth launcher: https://modrinth.com/app
2. Launch the app and follow the instructions. (You don't need to sign in with a Modrinth account; you can skip that step).
3. Following the instructions, sign in with your Minecraft (Microsoft) account into the launcher.
4. Search for *SMP-Essentials* in the modpack search. Install it. 
:::info
If you want to update the modpack simply click *Update* on the top-right of the Modpack screen. If you want to add your own mods to it, go into the modpack Options and scroll all the way to the bottom. There is an option called *Unlock*. The pack will remain linked, and you can still change versions. Only mods listed in the modpack will be modified on version changes.

## Modpack Features

- [Proximity Voicechat](./Features/vc.md)
- Improve your ping with [Raknet](./Features/raknetify.md)
- [Litematica](pathname://https://litematica.org/)
- View the lightlevel by pressing `f8`. Configure it with `f7`. Orange means mobs can spawn at night. Red means mobs can always spawn.

- Entity Texture Features, which adds a lot of skin and ressource pack related features. For example, [you can make your skin glow or animate](pathname://https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/ETF-Main/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) (like blinking eyes).
- Tons of performance mods
- Shader support. A custom modification of the [Bliss shaderpack](pathname://https://github.com/X0nk/Bliss-Shader/releases) is also included.
- Connected textures
- Controller support
- Minimap. If you think the Minimap is annoying, you can turn it of by heading into your settings: `ESC > Mods > Xaero's Minimap > Minimap:`

## FAQ

### I have a Mac and I have problems with the Modpack.

Some of the mods might be incompatible with Mac. A known one (for now, might be fixed later) is Distant Horizons. You can remove the mod by going into the modpack settings and using the *Unlock* setting. Then, you can disable or remove the mod from the modpack while still being able to automatically update the modpack. The proximity voice chat often also doesn't work.

### My voice chat doesn't work.

If you're on Mac, this is a known problem. There are workarounds but I won't provide support for it because it's not easy to fix. Look it up on Google. If you're not on Mac, you probably still have push-to-talk on. You can disable it in the voicechat settings (press `v`). More info [here](./Features/vc.md). You might also have the wrong microphone or headphone connected. You can also change that in the settings. If all of that doesn't work, try re-joining and ask your friend to also rejoin.

### Do I need the modpack to play on the server?

No, it's not mandatory, but recommended because it contains a proximity voice chat mod that we actively use in the game.
