# Proximity Voicechat

We use a [proximity voice chat mod](pathname://https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) that lets you speak to other player in the game. We recommend you install the mod with [our modpack](../modpack.md) as it's much quicker to install and update. If you don't want to use the modpack, you can of course also install the mod yourself.

## Usage

Below are a couple of default key bindings that will help you with using the mod. You can change the key bindings in your controls settings.

- `v`: Open voice chat settings to adjust your microphone and speaker. We recommend setting your microphone not to push-to-talk for a more natural talking experience. There is also a noise suppresion setting to turn off the background noise picked up by your mic.
- `g`: Open the group window for creating and joining group calls. When using groups you can hear your friend anywhere. If you set your group to *Open* everyone around you that's not inside the group can also hear you.
- `n`: Disable the voice chat.
