# Raknetify

We have a mod called [Raknetify](pathname://https://github.com/RelativityMC/raknetify#how-to-use-it) in our [modpack](../modpack.md) that lets you improve your connection and ping significantly. If you're from a different continent like the USA and usually have a bad ping, you can try this solution to improve it.

## Usage

Simply join the server with the IP `raknet;survival-pi.com` instead of the usual `survival-pi.com`. (Use `raknetl;survival-pi.com` for high mtu size.) If you're having any issues, please ask in the help channel of the Discord.
