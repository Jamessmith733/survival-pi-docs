# Rules

1. No griefing
2. No stealing
3. No cheats, including no xray and Freeca (You can use `/s` if you need a survival-friendly Spectator mode). You're allowed to use Litematica, but  auto-miners and printer mods are considered cheats! If you want to be safe, just use the server's official modpack.
4. No item dupers
5. Keep chat appropriate. No racism, no rascist jokes, etc. Respect everyone!
6. No chunk loaders (for reducing lag). You may build them in some cases when necessary, but please talk to an Admin before.
7. Keep spawn and the area around builds nice looking: Use the official mining desert and mesa for sand. Mine dirt, trees, and other stuff far away from spawn and builds. Don't leave flying trees. Repair creeper holes.
