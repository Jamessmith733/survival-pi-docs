# Link Discord

We have a discord channel that lets you chat with players on the server. If you want to use it, you need to link your Minecraft account with your Discord account. Follow the following steps:


1. Open Minecraft, and join the server. Then open chat, and type `/discord link`. You will see a message in chat that contains a four digit code. Remember that code.
2. Message the [Survival-Pi bot](pathname://https://discordapp.com/users/922179321592963103) a message containing only the code from previously.
