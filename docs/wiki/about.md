:::info
If you're just here to join the Creative plots server you can join without applying! It's public! The IP is `survival-pi.com`.
:::

We are a friendly and active community of mostly young adults and teenager that enjoy playing Minecraft after a tiring day at work or school. We like to keep things as Vanilla as possible while also having some extra Vanilla-friendly features to complement the experience. 

We build beautiful bases and massive community mega project. We also have an active community-managed economy at Spawn. Additionally, you can talk to players in-game with proximity voice chat. For more info about the server and the features we have, see [below](#at-a-glance) or in the [Features section](./Features/features.md).

You are creative? You enjoy building and meeting new friends? We'd be happy to welcome you to the community! You can apply on our [Discord](pathname://https://discord.gg/WKAtDzEu24) with the application form below. If you decide to apply, you can include the word *stardust* in your application, so we know that you checked out this website before applying ðŸ˜Š
