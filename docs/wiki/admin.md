# For Admins

Running the server takes a lot of time. If you help me with doing some basic moderating stuff, I can allocate more of my time to the technical side of running the server ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Minecraft Commands

### Check player logs for x-ray

If somebody wants to cheat they will always find a way. However, x-ray is the first and easiest cheat they will try to use. Therefore, we can more easily filter out new players by having anti-x-ray intentionally disabled and checking on them once in a while. It's really easy to do and fun detective work too üòä

- `/co l u:USER t:30d b:deepslate_diamond_ore`\
Go in spectator with `/gm 3`. Click on the coords to teleport to the location.
- `/co l u:USER t:30d b:deepslate_diamond_ore r:20`\
Radius check.
- `/co i`\
More [here](./Features/coreprotect.md).

### Rollbacks

Please be careful with running these command! They can do irreversible damage and chaos when executed wrongly.

- `/co rollback YoloBurny t:2h radius:20 b:shulker_box action:-block`\
Rollback of YoloBurny removing a shulker box in a radius of 20 blocks within 2h of it happening.
- `/co l u:#tnt r:20`
- `/co l u:#fire r:20`
- `/irp restore`\
Rollback play inventory backups. Inventory backups on join and on death. Make sure to 100% confirm that the player is eligible for a rollback (i.e., server lagg) and not just died because of their own fault.

### Open inventories
