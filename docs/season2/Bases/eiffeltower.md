    Just the Eiffel tower. It's my second base and my first mega base on the server. I will probably use it for a while until I start my scifi base with QuesiBoy.

## Build Process

I looked up half the internet and realized, there was no good schematic of the Eiffel tower that was true to the real proportions and also looked decent. So I decided to build one from scratch. I started with a picture of the Eiffel Tower and calculated the proportions. Because I wanted to keep the Eiffel tower between sea level and world height, I needed to convert the dimensions accordingly. Below are the notes I created to do that:

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 auto", height: "450px", maxWidth: "50%", overflow: "hidden", position: "relative" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/season2/bases/eiffeltower/drawing.webp"
      style={{ height: "100%", width: "auto", objectFit: "contain", display: "block" }}
      alt="Eiffel Tower Drawing"
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 auto", height: "450px", maxWidth: "50%", overflow: "hidden", position: "relative" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/season2/bases/eiffeltower/outline.webp"
      style={{ height: "100%", width: "auto", objectFit: "contain", display: "block" }}
      alt="Eiffel Tower Outline"
    />
  </div>
</div>
<br />

I built the tower in Creative. Above is also a picture of an early outline.

After finishing the build in Creative, I needed to find a spot in the Survival world to build it. I chose a spot not too far from Spawn. 

Since I designed the tower for sea-level to build-heigh, I needed to flatten out the area. That took way longer than I expected. I mined more than 70k stone and 50k grass blocks for that. But it was even more than that because thankfully a lot of people helped me on the way! Eventually, the flattening of the hill, I made some custom terrain and expanded the area a bit into the water to make space. 

After the terraforming was done, I started gathering the ressources. Since nobody had a working jungle wood farm, the jungle wood (16 double chests) had to be mined by hand. A lot of people helped me with that (see above). It was very grindy but also a lot of fun.

Below is a picture of the terraforming process and the materials.

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 auto", height: "100%", maxWidth: "50%", overflow: "hidden", position: "relative" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/season2/bases/eiffeltower/2024-07-25_22.08.56.png"
      style={{ height: "100%", width: "auto", objectFit: "contain", display: "block" }}
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 auto", height: "100%", maxWidth: "50%", overflow: "hidden", position: "relative" }}>
    <img
      src="/img/season2/bases/eiffeltower/2024-08-03_20.56.30.png"
      style={{ height: "100%", width: "auto", objectFit: "contain", display: "block" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
<br />

After all the terraforming was done and all the materials were gathered, we started building the thing. Philipp helped building and Zulugerste did most of the wood stripping.
