# Shopping District

![pic](/img/season2/spawn.png)

The economy is managed by the community. Outside of the very small spawn-protected area, admins have no power! The community-elected mayor is responsible for keeping the shopping district nice-looking and manages the themes. See [here](./season2.md) to learn who is Mayor at the moment.

## I want to build a shop

**If you want to get a plot ask the mayor.** The mayor is responsible for keeping it fair for everyone and ensures Spawn looks nice. ☺️ 

**Districts:** Medieval/market, modern/industrial, fantasy, goofy themed shops.

**Price:** 3 Picobitcoins per block. All the money goes towards funding the Nether highway, the shopping district, and other community projects.

## Currency

This season, we're a little bit more flexible about the currency. **The owner of the shop decides what they want as a currency.** Most people like to use **Diamonds** or the less inflationary and fractional currency **Bitcoins**. You can invest in Bitcoin with the Villager at Spawn. ☺️
