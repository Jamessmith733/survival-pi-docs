# Shopping District

The economy and Spawn is managed by the community. The community-elected mayor is responsible for keeping the shopping district nice-looking and manages the themes. See [here](./season2.md) to learn who is Mayor at the moment. 

The mayor and the minister of building came up with a plan for Spawn, the shopping district, and the economy. Read below for more information. If you have questions, ask the Mayor or other players.

## I want to build a shop

The mayor and minister of building decided they want a flexible shop system keeps Spawn nice looking and also funds community projects. Here is all you need to know:

- **Districts:** Medieval/market, modern/industrial, fantasy, themed shops. Build your shop in the district that fits your design. Below is a picture of where the districts are located.

- **Price:** 3 Picobitcoins per block. For example, a `10 x 10` plot is `100 x 3 = 300 PB`. All the money goes towards funding the Nether highway, the shopping district, and other community projects.

- **Maximum plot size:** `25 x 25` or any plot size equivalent to that area. If you need more space than that, ask the Mayor and he'll find a spot for your shop.

- **Where to pay for shop:** Enter the townhall (Big building in Medieval/market district). In the big hall is a lectern with a barrel underneath. Put your payment into the barrel.

## Currency

This season, we're a little bit more flexible about the currency. Currently we're using **diamonds** and **bitcoin** as stated in the rules you have to be able to pay with both currencies at your shop, this does not mean it has to be a fair price though. You can invest in Bitcoin with the Villager at Spawn. You can also create your own currency if you want to. ☺️
