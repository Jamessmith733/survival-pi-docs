Season 2 has started after a fun 3.5 years of [Season 1](../season1/season1.md)! This season we voted on various things and decided to do things a little differently.

## All you need to know

- **Spawn** is now community-managed. No plots and only 6 blocks Spawn protection. 
- We democratically elected a Mayor and some ministers that are responsible for organizing Spawn and the community. Admins have no power! Above is a list of all roles we elected. We might at some point re-elect the roles if we want to.
- The **economy** is also managed by the community. Want to build a shop? Read [here](./shopping_district.md) for more information.
- We decided that we will build *ugly undecorated farms* at least **2000 blocks out**, so everyone has more unobstructed space to build their bases.
- To learn more about the other server features, check out [our wiki](../wiki/Features/features.md).
- Read the [server rules](../wiki/rules.md) if you're new to the server.
